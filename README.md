# Inventify
Inventify is a platform designed for efficient inventory management and streamlined order processing, utilizing a structured three-tier system: Admin, Managers, and Staff. This hierarchical approach ensures clarity in roles and responsibilities, promoting optimal inventory control and operational efficiency.

<h2>Key Features and Functions:</h2>

**1. Admins:**
Admins have the responsibility of overseeing all inventory roles within the platform. They ensure that each user is assigned the appropriate role and access level.

**2. Managers:**
Managers can add new products to the inventory, edit existing product details, and delete products that are no longer needed. This ensures that the inventory is always up-to-date and relevant to the current needs. Also they are responsible for reviewing and approving or disapproving order requests submitted by Staff. 

**3. Staff:**
Staff members handle the initial stages of order processing. They receive orders from retailers and send approval requests to Managers.Also they serve as the communication bridge between retailers and Managers, ensuring that any issues or special requests are conveyed accurately and promptly.

**4. Retailers:**
Retailers can browse the product catalog and place orders directly through the Inventify platform. This simplifies the ordering process and ensures that retailers have access to the latest products. 
Also they can track the status of their orders in real-time, from approval to delivery, ensuring transparency and trust in the process.


This hierarchical approach ensures streamlined order management, optimal inventory control, and enhanced operational efficiency.
